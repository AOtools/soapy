# Example configuration file for AO system with single, on-axis LGS.
# LGS features realistic uplink propagation, so a NGS TT sensor also present
# LGS launched from primary 1m telescope aperture ("monostatic" configuration), 
# the size of the launched beam requires the LGS to be 1) focused at 90km and 2) 
# precompensated by applying DM correction before launch. However, a much tighter 
# (and therefore brighter) LGS spot results.
