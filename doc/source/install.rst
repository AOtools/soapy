Installation
************

Firstly, you'll need Python. This comes with pretty much every linux distribution and is also installed by default on Mac OS X. For Windows, I'd recommend using a Python distribution, such as anaconda or enthought canopy. The code should be compatible with Windows as Python and all the libraries used are platform independent. Nonetheless, I only use it on Mac OSX and Linux so I can't guarantee that there won't be bugs not present on other OSs.

============
Installation
============
Once all the requirements outlined below are met, you are ready to install PyAOS. Download the source from `github <https://github.com/andrewpaulreeves/pyAOS>`_, either as a zip file, or clone the git repository with::

    git clone https://github.com/andrewpaulreeves/pyAOS.git

If downloading the code as a zip, you can choose which version to use with the drop down box on the left of the page, entitled ``branch:master``. Whilst I try not to, the master branch will occasionally be broken so you might want to get the latest stable version by clicking "tags" in the dropdown list, and selecting the most recent version number.

Once the code is downloaded (and unzipped) or cloned, navigate to the resulting directory using the command line. You can import it into python straight away from this directory. To use the ``pyAOS`` script, run::

python pyAOS <options> <configfile>


If you wish to have it available elsewhere on your system, either set the relavant ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` variables to ``<pyAOS dir>/bin`` and ``<pyAOS dir>/pyAOS`` respectively, or run the install script with::

    python setup.py install

This latter method may require superuser permissions for your system and should setup the paths for you. You should now be able to run ``pyAOS`` and import pyAOS into python from any directory on your system.

==================
Required Libraries
==================

pyAOS doesn't have too many requirements in terms of external libraries, though it does rely on some. There are also some optional libraries which are recommended for plotting or performance.

--------
Required

::

    numpy
    scipy
    pyfits *or* astropy

::

    pyfftw (Highly Recommended!)

for gui

::
    
    PyQt4
    pyqtgraph (http://www.pyqtgraph.org)
    matplotlib
    ipython
    

=====
Linux
=====
If your starting with python from scratch, there a couple of options. For Ubuntu (and probably debian) linux users, all these packages can be installed via apt-get::
    
    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-fftw python-pyfits python-qt4 python-matplotlib ipython ipython-qtconsole python-pyqtgraph
    
    
for Red-hat based systems these packages should also be available from repositories, though I'm not sure of they're names. Again, get pyqtgraph from http://www.pyqtgraph.org, but download the source. pyqtgraph, like most python packages is pretty easy to install from source, just download the package, unpack, navigate into the package and run ``sudo python setup.py install``
    
=======
Mac OSX
=======

for mac os, all of these packages can be install via macports, with::
    
    sudo port install python27 py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-pyfits py27-pyfftw py27-pyqt4 py27-ipython py27-pyqtgraph


======
Any OS
======

For any OS, including Windows, python distributions exist which include lots of python packages useful for science. A couple of good examples are Enthought Canopy (https://www.enthought.com), which is free for academics, and Anaconda (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) which is also free.


A lot of python packages are also listed on `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_. Usually when python is installed, a script called ``easy_install`` is installed also, which can be used to get any package on pypi with ``easy_install <package>``. Confusingly, ``pip`` is now the recommended Python package manager instead of ``easy_install``. If you've only got ``easy_install`` you can install ``pip`` using ``easy_install pip``, or it can be installed using the script linked `here <https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_.

Once you have ``pip``, the required libraries can be installed by using the ``requirements.txt`` file. From the pyAOS directory, just run (may need to be as ``sudo``)::

    pip -r requirements.txt
    
and all the requirements should be installed for you!

=======
Testing
=======
Once you think everything is installed, tests can be run by navigating to the ``test`` directory and running ::
    
    python testSimulation.py

Currenlty, this only runs system wide tests, but further, more atomic tests will be added in future.
