Contributing to SOAPY
---------------------

Contributing to SOPY is very much encouraged. I haven't an enormous amount of time to add new code and features to SOAPY, so if you can and want to help please do! 

To begin, make yourself a fork using the Github interface, then use the resulting repository as your origin for local git repositories. Once you've implemented a feature or fix, again use the github interface to issue a "pull-request".
